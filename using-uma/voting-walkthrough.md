# Voting Walkthrough

This tutorial describes how to vote using the [UMA voter dApp](https://vote.umaproject.org/). For context, each voting period is 48hrs. Voting takes 3 steps:

* Commit Vote: the first 24hrs of a voting period allows you to encrypt and commit your vote
* Reveal vote: the second 24hrs of a voting period allows you to decrypt and reveal your vote. Votes are tallied by a DVM smart contract at the end of the reveal period.
* Claim rewards: At the end of each reveal period, you claim $UMA inflation rewards generated by the protocol, if you voted correctly as determined by the DVM.

### Instructions:

1. Go to [http://vote.umaproject.org/](http://vote.umaproject.org/)
2. Connect your metamask wallet and sign the transaction&#x20;

* Type your vote for each vote under the **"current vote"** dropdown.
* Click the **"commit vote"** button
* You can edit your vote after you commit, before the reveal period starts. MAKE YOUR VOTE COUNT: make sure that your $UMA tokens are in the account you use to commit a vote before the reveal period begins. A snapshot is taken at the beginning of the reveal period.

**Reveal period:** If there are committed votes to reveal, you’ll see them in the “Active Requests” table.

* Review your committed votes
* Click the **“reveal vote”** button. Once revealed, this cannot be undone.

**Claim rewards:** If there are rewards to claim, you’ll see a “Claim rewards” button at the top of the dApp.
