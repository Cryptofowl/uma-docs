# oSnap

This section showcases oSnap, which lets members of a DAO execute the results of any given Snapshot vote via a Safe with validation by UMA. This is made possible by having a published set of rules and public information secured by UMAâ€™s optimistic oracle.

The process of integrating oSnap includes:

* [Deployment tutorial](osnap-deployment-tutorial.md) using the Zodiac module
* [Snapshot tutorial ](snapshot-tutorial.md)to configure and execute transactions with Snapshot proposals
* An overview on [verifying and disputing](osnap-proposal-verification.md) proposed transactions
* Updating the oSnap using [admin functions](osnap-module-admin-functions.md)

Or you can get a high-level overview with our [Quick Start guide](osnap-quick-start.md).
