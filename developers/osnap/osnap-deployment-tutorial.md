# ðŸŽ¯ oSnap Deployment Tutorial

**Creating a Safe:**

Visit [https://app.safe.global/](https://app.safe.global/) to deploy and access your Safe. If you do not have a safe created, select the â€˜Create new Safeâ€™ button and follow [these](https://help.gnosis-safe.io/en/articles/3876461-creating-a-safe-on-a-web-browser) instructions to deploy a safe. Select â€˜Add existing Safeâ€™ if you would like to use an existing safe with your oSnap module.

_Note: Confirm your wallet is set to the appropriate network if the safe isnâ€™t displayed._

**Accessing the Zodiac app:**

Once connected to your safe, take the following steps to get to the Zodiac apps page:

* Step 1: Click â€˜Appsâ€™ displayed on the left sidebar.&#x20;
* Step 2: In the search bar, input â€˜Zodiacâ€™.
* Step 3: Select â€˜Zodiacâ€™ from the search results.

**Deploying an oSnap module:**

To deploy a new oSnap module, click the option with the title â€˜UMA Optimistic Governor Moduleâ€™:

A modal will open with deployment parameters. The first three parameters below are associated with the oSnap module and can be updated after deployment. Refer [here](../setting-custom-bond-and-liveness-parameters.md) to better understand how to appropriately set these parameters:

* **Collateral:** The ERC20 token used for the bond. The options in the Zodiac app are USDC and WETH.
* **Bond:** The bond value is the amount proposers (and disputers) are required to post in the collateral currency. The minimum recommended bond values are 1,500 USDC and 1 WETH.
* **Liveness:** The length of time a proposal can be disputed. The minimum recommended liveness period is 6 hours to allow Disputers to verify a proposal follows the rules.

The three parameters below are associated with the â€˜rulesâ€™ parameter of the oSnap module and used by Disputers and Voters to resolve potential disputes.&#x20;

* **Snapshot Space URL:** The Snapshot space that is assigned to the oSnap module. To learn more about Snapshot spaces, visit the Snapshot [documentation](https://docs.snapshot.org/spaces/what-is-a-space).
* **Voting Quorum:** The minimum number of vote participation required for a valid proposal. For example, the proposal should not be considered valid if the voting quorum parameter is 5% and the proposal only had 3% voter participation.
* **Voting Period:** The minimum voting period that should be associated with a proposal. Any voting period set for a proposal that is less than the parameter set in the rules will not be considered a valid proposal.

After setting the deployment parameters, click â€˜Add Moduleâ€™. Use the â€˜Simulateâ€™ button to simulate the transaction using Tenderly. If successful, click â€˜Submitâ€™ and follow the steps to sign the transaction.

Once deployed, select the contract on the left sidebar of the Zodiac App. The â€˜Read Contractâ€™ tab displays the parameters of your contract, such as the collateral and required bond amount. The â€˜Write Contractâ€™ tab enables the owner to perform admin functions described in more detail in the [admin functions section](osnap-module-admin-functions.md).

**Next Steps:**

The next tutorial will demonstrate how to use the deployed oSnap module to execute Snapshot transaction data.
