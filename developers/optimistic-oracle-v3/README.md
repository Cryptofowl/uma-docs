# Optimistic Oracle

This section showcases different design patterns for building contracts that integrate with the UMA Optimistic Oracle v3. These include:

* A [quick start tutorial](../quick-start.md) showcasing the simplest possible OOv3 integration contract.
* Building example contracts:
  * [Prediction market](broken-reference)
  * [Insurance contract](broken-reference)
  * [A generic data assertion framework](broken-reference)
* A description of [Escalation Managers](escalation-managers.md) and how they can be used.
* Deploying [sandboxed oracle environment](../optimistic-oracle/sandboxed-oracle-environment.md) for testing the dispute flow.
